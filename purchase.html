    <h4>AGGRESSIVELY EFFICIENT
        If you’ve got a soft spot for sportbike design and Grand Prix stylings, then the 2021 Honda CBR300R is your sweet spot between form and function. It’s narrow, light, and a total blast to ride around town and on twisty back roads. The single-cylinder engine offers great fuel economy, with smooth and friendly torque delivery. And the affordable cost and responsive handling makes it a terrific bike for first-time riders, and for those looking to grow their garage. There’s even a version available with our anti-lock braking system. Plus, this year the CBR300R brings hot new graphics in two color choices. Time to get riding!</h4>
